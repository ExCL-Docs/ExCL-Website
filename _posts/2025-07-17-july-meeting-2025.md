# ExCL Monthly Meeting Highlights – July 2025

Welcome to the July highlights from the **Experimental Computing Laboratory (ExCL)**! This month’s meeting focused on planning for future upgrades, sharing updates on resources, and a recap of the cause of a recent outage.

---

## System Updates

The **Equinox system**, one of our older GPU platforms, is being phased out due to hardware issues. Projects needing multiple GPUs should reach out so we can ensure resources are available.

---

## Looking Ahead: New Capabilities

We’re exploring exciting new hardware options to expand ExCL’s research capabilities, including:

* Next-generation AI and GPU systems
* FPGA and accelerator platforms
* Infrastructure upgrades to support growth

---

## Community Input

We continue to welcome feedback from our users — especially around system needs, project requirements, and upcoming resource opportunities.
