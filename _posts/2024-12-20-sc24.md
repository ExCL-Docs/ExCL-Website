## About the Session

**Testbeds: Pioneering the Future of Supercomputing**  
Testbeds are critical for evaluating the readiness of novel architectures as we move toward exascale and post-exascale computing. They serve as hubs for co-design, helping researchers gather operational requirements from applications and identify critical gaps that need to be addressed for future architectures to succeed in HPC environments.

At the BoF session, experts shared insights into:

- Designing innovative testbeds  
- Benchmarking for performance and readiness  
- Evaluating systems with real-world applications  
- Best practices and collaboration across research centers  

The discussion fostered an invaluable exchange of knowledge and strengthened our collective understanding of the resources needed to tackle the next generation of computational challenges.

## ExCL's Role

ExCL's mission is to drive innovation and research in computer science, HPC, and microelectronics by enabling researchers with flexible access to a diverse selection of cutting-edge systems and testbeds complete with infrastructure in place to support collaborative research in a heterogeneous cluster environment. At SC24, we shared our experiences, learned from our peers, and contributed to shaping the community's vision for the future of HPC architectures.

We look forward to building on these discussions and continuing to push the boundaries of whatâ€™s possible in high-performance computing and advanced heterogeneous testbeds.
