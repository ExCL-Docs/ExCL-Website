# ExCL Monthly Meeting Highlights --- May 2025

The Experimental Computing Laboratory (ExCL) at Oak Ridge National Laboratory held its monthly meeting on **May 15, 2025**, offering a variety of updates on system infrastructure, software improvements, and the official deployment of the powerful **Mi300a** system. Here are the key takeaways from this month‚Äôs meeting.

---

## üñ•Ô∏è Infrastructure & System Status

- **`news` Shell Command**: A new command-line utility `news` is now available to keep users informed of system status changes. The login banner will notify users of unread items. Eventually, this will integrate with the `news@excl.groups.io` mailing list.

- **Mi300a ("Faraday")**: Officially deployed and ready for use.

- **U280 FPGA**: Deployed to `milan3`, with updated SLURM helper functions and environment setup.

- **ThinLinc**: Updated to version **4.18**.

- **Account Automation**: Improved reporting and automation reduce the burden of manual account management.

- **Security**: Gateway machines will now **auto-update and reboot weekly** to improve vulnerability management.

- **TinyPilot Update**: New run script menu enables **remote system resets** via REISUB.

- **Siemens Remix and Licensing**: Deployed with no changes to user selections.
