# Monthly Meeting Highlights - Experimental Computing Laboratory (ExCL) - April 2025

The ExCL April 2025 meeting showcased progress on infrastructure, upcoming projects, and a range of updates to ExCL’s resources. Here’s a breakdown of the key points discussed:

## 1. **Infrastructure/System Status**
   Several key updates were shared regarding the current infrastructure:
   - **news Command**: A new shell command (`news`) has been deployed, providing up-to-date information on system statuses. This will allow users to access real-time updates on ExCL's infrastructure.
   - **Mi300a**: Deployment is still experiencing delays due to parts availability, but a new motherboard has been installed. Networking issues are being addressed by CTG Federal.
   - **Automated Account Reporting**: Significant work has been done to automate account reporting and management, reducing manual oversight and improving efficiency.
   - **Vulnerability Management**: Gateway machines will now auto-update every Thursday night at 10 PM, with automatic reboots if necessary, ensuring systems remain secure.

## 2. **news Command Output**
   A snapshot of the `news` command provided the latest updates:
   - **Mi300a Parts Delay**: Parts for the Mi300a deployment are still pending.
   - **Equinox GPU Error**: An error with the Equinox GPUs was reported. Reseating the NVLink cabling is planned to resolve this, with the fix scheduled for the week of April 21.

## 3. **Python/Marimo Automated Account Database Linting and Reporting**
   ExCL introduced a new automated account database linting and reporting system built on **Python** and **Marimo**. This system enhances the accuracy of account data and simplifies reporting tasks, making the process more efficient and less prone to human error.

## 4. **Plans for the Next Three Months**
   ExCL outlined its plans for the upcoming quarter:
   - Continued **documentation and capability updates**.
   - Deployment of the **ARC Pro A60 card** and **AMD Xilinx U280**.
   - Ongoing work on the **deployment backlog**, focusing on lower-priority devices.
   - Preparation for the **Translational Research Capability** move from **5100/227 to 3700/A102**. This includes infrastructure work like moving racks to **D102**, enhancing power distribution, and addressing networking needs.

## 5. **Meeting Notifications and Groups.io**
   ExCL keeps users informed about upcoming meetings via their **Groups.io mailing list**. Meeting notifications include an `.ics` calendar file to easily add events to your calendar. For Outlook users, the calendar invite can be accessed directly from the email preview.

## 6. **Documentation Updates — Remote Development Roadmap**
   The **Remote Development** guide has been updated to reflect best practices and new workflows for remote access to ExCL systems. This includes tools for development outside the ExCL environment:

## 9. **ExCL Project Storage**
   ExCL provides **shared project storage** for collaborative work, offering secure access to project subvolumes on the ZFS filesystem. Key features include:
   - Access via **automounted NFS** share at `/auto/projects/<project_name>`.
   - Strict access control to ensure security, with **Access Control Lists (ACLs)** managing permissions.
   - Only project members have read, write, and execute access to their specific project directory.
   - Project directories cannot be listed by unauthorized users.

## 10. **Questions/Discussions/Comments**
   During the meeting, some additional topics were discussed:
   - **Summer Intern Accounts**: A reminder to use the `Interns2025` project ID for interns, along with any additional project identifiers.
   - **Project/Shared Storage**: More information was shared about shared storage options for collaborative projects.
