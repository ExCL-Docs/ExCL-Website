# About ExCL

The Experimental Computing Laboratory (ExCL) was established in 2004 with the goal of providing application users and computer scientists with access to systems with leading edge architectures and software.

ExCL is managed by the ORNL [Advanced Computing Systems Research Section](https://www.ornl.gov/section/advanced-computing-systems-research) at ORNL. 
ExCL researchers investigate architectures such as multi- and many-core processors, Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), non-volatile memory systems, Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), and highly heterogeneous systems. See our current resources at [ExCL Resources](https://docs.excl.ornl.gov/system-overview).

Over the years, ExCL has adapted to the demands of the researchers of the Future Technologies Group (now the Advanced Computing Research Section) and their collaborators. Now, ExCL is opening to all researchers throughout the world that work in Computer Science research. ExCL aims at being an open and collaborative platform where cutting edge computing research takes place.

ExCL is a production research laboratory. It provides the flexibility of pure research systems, while offering a production quality service and support. This support also includes an active role by ORNL ACSR researchers in that these researchers can share their expertise and knowledge about the system and technologies with the users.

If you need something else, please let us know. If your workflow cannot be accommodated in the current ExCL infrastructure, also contact us and we will try to work it out. 

Happy computing!
